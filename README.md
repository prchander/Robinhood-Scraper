# Robinhood-Scraper
This is a series of scripts I've created in order to better track
my finances. 

These scripts generate two CSV files
* orders.csv
	* Spreadsheet of all orders made on your Robinhood account
* sorted\_stockwise\_pl.csv
	* Spreadsheet of the net Profit/Loss of each company/stock you've
	ever traded on your Robinhood account, sorted with your biggest
	gains at the top, and biggest losses at the bottom.

I am currently working on a simple GUI to make the experience a little
easier and aesthetically pleasing. I'm starting with Tkinter() for 
simplicity but plan to try out PyQt5 in the near future.

## How to Use
Until I get the GUI working, you will only need Python3
